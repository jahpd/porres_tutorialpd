# Puredata Tutorial 

Original authors's work is Alexandre Porres. I believe that this is the one of most complete PD tutorials made. This book "translate" results in a WebPD environment.

Below, a simple renderized patch in svg (without render with audio).

So, i think i need contributions.

{% patch %}/en/01.Introduction/1.Presentation/Hi_2.pd{% endpatch %}

{% patch %}/en/01.Introduction/1.Presentation/Hi_3.pd{% endpatch %}
