# Git

The [Git](http://git-scm.com/)'s webpage says: "Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency". This [guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) will help you. But, for eletronic musicians, what the fucking hell is this?

Imagine you made some funny patches. But today is working, and tomorrow not. And them change the code. Now is working. Then you share the code with a friend. But the patch won't work in his or her computer. Maybe you write with a library that exist in a Unix system, but not in Windows system.

If these three versions codes have been versioned, you could investigate and customize each version, and help other peoples to improve a default version. The patch will no longer be mine. But our. It's a very scientific way to improve texts and softwares.
