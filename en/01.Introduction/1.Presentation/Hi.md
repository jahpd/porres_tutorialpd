# Hi

In Pure Data:;We program by conecting "boxes", from "outlets" to "inlets"!;

## Click on the box that says "Hello_World!"

{% patch %}Hi_1.pd{% endpatch %}

## Click on the message and see the result at Pd's terminal

The `print` object prints messages at the terminal window (check it there).

{% patch %}Hi_2.pd{% endpatch %}

An empty message box does not send anything. That is why the print object does not print anything when we click it.;

{% patch %}Hi_3.pd{% endpatch %}
