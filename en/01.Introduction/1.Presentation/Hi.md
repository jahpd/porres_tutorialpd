# Hi

In Pure Data, we program by conecting "boxes", from "outlets" to "inlets"!

## Click on the box that says "Hello_World!"

{% patch %}porres_examples/Hi_1.pd{% endpatch %}


## Click on the message and see the result at Pd's terminal

The `print` object prints messages at the terminal window (check it there).
AD
{% patch %}porres_examples/Hi_2.pd{% endpatch %}

## An empty message box does not send anything. 

{% patch %}porres_examples/Hi_3.pd{% endpatch %}

That is why the print object does not print anything when we click it.;
