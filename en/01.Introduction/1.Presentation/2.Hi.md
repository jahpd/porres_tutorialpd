# Hi

In Pure Data:;
We program by conecting "boxes", from "outlets" to "inlets"!;

## Click on the box that says "Hello_World!"

{% webpd "en/01.Introduction/1.Presentation/2.Hi(1).pd" %} {% endwebpd %}

## Click on the message and see the result at Pd's terminal

The [print] object prints messages at the terminal window (check it there).

{% webpd "en/01.Introduction/1.Presentation/2.Hi(2).pd" %} {% endwebpd %}

An empty message box does not send anything. That is why the print object does not print anything when we click it.;

{% webpd "en/01.Introduction/1.Presentation/2.Hi(3).pd" %} {% endwebpd %}
